To stast the application first populate the data stored in .dat files by using Polplate.java code.
My application currently supports SQLPlus 11g by Oracle.
If you want to setup the complete database on your PC in any local database like SQL, MySQL, or PostgreSQL run the program of createDB.sql

Then run the HW3.java and GUI will pop up.
The GUI will allow user to select Genres, Year range, "AND"-"OR" operator to be applied between the selections.
And different features follows the same way.

Key Functionalities:

Indexing: I have implemented indexing over the most crucial data that is accessed very often to make the relevant search fast.
Normalisation: To reduce the redundancy of the relations I have used normalisation in proper aspect till 3_NF.

Various other features are added to make the functionality more smooth and robust.
